🚗 DriveWise – Smart Maintenance
DriveWise – Smart Maintenance is a comprehensive web application created to simplify the process of managing vehicle maintenance and exploring different car options based on user preferences. It focuses on providing a smooth and interactive experience using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and easy to run on any system without backend dependency.

🔧 Maintenance Module

The Maintenance Module allows users to record, update, and track their vehicle service activities. Users can enter details such as the maintenance task, date of service, and related notes. This creates an organized log that helps users monitor their vehicle’s health over time. The goal of this module is to make maintenance tracking simple, clear, and accessible, providing users with a digital record of all service tasks performed on their vehicle.

💰 Price Filter Module

The Price Filter Module enables users to explore cars based on a selected price range. Once a budget is chosen, the application displays a list of cars that fall within that range along with essential details such as specifications, features, and a review video. This module helps users quickly filter through multiple car options and make well-informed decisions without having to manually compare vehicles from various sources.

🚘 Brands Module

The Brands Module provides a clean and organized view of popular car brands. Each brand logo redirects users to the official website of the manufacturer, allowing easy exploration of car models, features, and brand-specific details. This module enhances user convenience by acting as a central hub for accessing official car brand information.
